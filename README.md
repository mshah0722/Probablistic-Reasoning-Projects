# Probablistic-Reasoning-Projects
Projects making use of different classes of probabilistic models and how, based on those models, one deduces actionable information from data

## Classification with Multinomial and Gaussian Models
1. Naive Bayes Classifier for Spam Filtering
2. Linear/Quadratic Discriminant Analysis for Height/Weight Data

## Bayesian Linear Regression
1. Using Bayesian regression to fit a linear model with Gaussian noise 
2. The parameter is modelled as a zero mean isotropic Gaussian random vector and estimated by deriving the posterior distribution.
